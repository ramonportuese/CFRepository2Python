# CFRepository2Python
Second Repository of Python Code from Career Foundry


This is also a school project from Career Foundry.  This project mainly used python inside of Jupyter Notebooks. 
This was a fictional project.  The scenario was that I was a data analyst for Instacart 
the online grocery store that opperates mainly through it's mobile app.  Instacart wanted 
to uncover more info on the company's sales patterns.  It was my role as a data analyst to
perform an initial data and explorary analysis of some of Instacart's data in order to derive 
insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.  


The stakeholders of Instacart are mainly interested in the variety of customers in their 
database along with their purchasing behaviors.  In this scenario it's the company's assumption 
that they can't target every single customer using the exact same method and they're considering
a target marketing strategy.  Instacart want's different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to
see if they have an effect on the sale of their products.  My analysis informs the company what strategy 
might be the best to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
